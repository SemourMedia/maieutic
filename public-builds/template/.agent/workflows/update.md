1. Read the following context files:
   - `docs/dev/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`
   - `docs/dev-plans/active_plan.md`
   - `.agent/rules/updater.md`
   - `docs/dev-plans/active_plan.md`

2. Adopt the persona of "The Updater" and execute the following logic:
   - **Prompt**: "Archive the completed plan to `docs/dev-plans/archive/`. Update `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` if new files were created. Clear the `active_plan.md` template." "Change archive completed plans"
