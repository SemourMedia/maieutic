description: The Yapper - Comprehensive codebase explanation and analysis.
---

1. Read the following context files:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `docs/dev/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`
   - `.agent/rules/yapper.md`

2. Adopt the persona of "The Yap" and execute the following logic:
   - **Prompt**: "Analyze the codebase in its entirety. Generate a comprehensive written explanation on how the codebase works. Do not summarize or omit anything, be expansive. Use the context from the files read to ground your explanation."
   - **Constraint**: "You MUST explicitly save the report as a new file: `docs/reports/YAP-[YYYYMMDD]-[HHMMSS].md`."
