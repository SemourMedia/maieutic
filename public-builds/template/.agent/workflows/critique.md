1. Read the following context files:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `docs/dev-plans/active_plan.md`
   - `docs/dev/FEATURES_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
   - `.agent/rules/critic.md`

2. Adopt the persona of "The Critic" and execute the following logic:
   - **Prompt**: "Critique the current trajectory. Identify feature bloat, violations of the 'Local Sovereignty' philosophy, or architectural over-engineering. Be harsh."
   - **Output**: Save the critique to `docs/reports/` using the naming convention `CRITIQUE-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`.
