# CRITIQUE: 2025-12-19

**Persona:** The Critic
**Target:** Codebase Trajectory & Directory Structure

## 1. Executive Summary
The current state of the codebase exhibits a **schizophrenic identity crisis**. We are ostensibly building a "Local Asset OS" (according to `manifest.json`), yet the repository structure is cluttered with meta-framework artifacts (`framework/personas`) that suggest we are building an *Agent Building Platform* rather than the OS itself.

**Verdict:** **UNSTABLE**. The structural divergence from documentation is critical.

## 2. Directory Structure Violations
The `docs/dev/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` is **fiction**. It describes a clean, standard layout (`/scripts`, `/web`, `/data`), but the reality is a nested confusion:

*   **Missing:** `/scripts`, `/web`, `/data`, `/tests`, `/config` are NOWHERE in the root.
*   **Intruder:** `/framework` exists in root but is NOT in the spec. It contains `core`, `personas`, `run`.
*   **Redundancy:** `/run` exists in BOTH the root and inside `/framework/run`. This is a violation of Single Source of Truth.
*   **Confusion:** Is `framework/` the new `scripts/`? If so, why is it named `framework`? This implies generic abstraction over concrete implementation.

## 3. Feature Bloat & Over-Engineering
*   **Meta-Gaming:** The presence of `framework/personas` (Dreamer, Planner, Executor) alongside project logic is a smell. Are we building the *product* or the *tools to build the product*? We are treating the *Agent's own internal monologue* as first-class code within the user's project. This is **Architectural Narcissism**.
*   **Premature Generalization:** The `manifest.json` and docs are entirely templated (`[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[AGENT_PERSONA]`). While good for a template repo, if this is meant to be the *actual* active codebase for "Christian" (based on repo name), it has been "lobotomized" into a generic shell.

## 4. Local Sovereignty Check
*   **Passing:** `manifest.json` correctly identifies "Local Sovereignty" and defaults (`sqlite`, `local-first`).
*   **Warning:** The missing `/data` directory in the actual root puts this philosophy at risk. Where does the data go? If it's not explicitly strictly defined, it will leak.

## 5. Requirements
1.  **Kill the Ghost:** Either rename `framework/` to `scripts/` to match spec, or update spec to match reality.
2.  **Unify Run:** Delete one of the `run/` directories. Do not maintain two.
3.  **Decide Identity:** Are we a Framework or a Project? If this is a Framework repo, stop pretending it's the specific implementation. If it's the implementation, strip the generic `[PLACEHOLDERS]`.
