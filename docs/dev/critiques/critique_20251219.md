# 🛑 CRITIQUE: [2025-12-19]

**Target:** Agnostic Framework Trajectory
**Persona:** The Critic

---

## 1. Vacuum of Purpose (The "Hollow Shell" Problem)
By extracting "Locality" and "Sovereignty" into variables like `[PHILOSOPHY_NAME]`, you have initialized a hollow shell. A framework must have opinions to be useful. "Local Asset OS" was powerful *because* it was opinionated about data ownership. This framework is apathetic. It allows the user to build a cloud-dependent, privacy-invading app just as easily as a sovereign one.
**Violation:** "Local Sovereignty" is now optional.

## 2. Bureaucratic Density
The ratio of documentation files (12+) to executable code (0) is a critical failure. The "Hierarchy of Truth" (`docs/dev/MASTER_SPECS.md`, `PHASES.md`, etc.) is currently a "Hierarchy of Blanks".
You require a user to fill out specific sections in 5 different Markdown files before they even write a generic "Hello World". This is architectural over-engineering. It creates massive friction for new projects.

## 3. Over-Abstraction of Identity
Variables like `[AGENT_IDENTITY]` and `[AGENT_PERSONA]` suggest a plug-and-play personality. However, personas are deeply tied to the tools they use and the permissions they hold. Decoupling them this aggressively risks creating schizophrenic agents with no grounded context. You are optimizing for a "generic agent" that does not exist.

## 4. Feature Bloat in Templates
`FEATURES_ENHANCEMENTS.md` includes complex templates for future features. Maintaining a roadmap for a *framework* is fine, but including a pre-structured "Bureaucracy" for a fresh project encourages "Planning-Before-Doing". This violates the agile principle of "Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation".

## ⛔ VERDICT: DANGEROUS TRAJECTORY
You are not building a "Sovereign Asset OS Framework". You are building a **Bureaucracy Generator**.
You have prioritized *structure* over *utility*.

### ⚡ IMMEDIATE CORRECTIONS REQUIRED:
1.  **Re-inject Opinions**: Hardcode "Local Sovereignty" back into the defaults. Let users opt-out, not opt-in to freedom.
2.  **Collapse Documentation**: Merge `PHASES.md` and `MASTER_SPECS.md` into a single `README.md` or `manifest.json` until project maturity > Alpha.
3.  **Ship Executables**: The framework needs an `init.py` script that *deletes* the templates and fills them with sane defaults, rather than expecting manual `[BRACKETED_TEXT]` replacement.
