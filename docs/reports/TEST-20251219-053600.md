# TEST REPORT: Plan 012 System Personalities

## 1. Test Summary
* **Date:** 2025-12-19
* **Focus:** Logic validation for `LLMAdapter` and Persona Rule Loading.
* **Status:** **PASS**
* **Tests Executed:** 5/5 passed.

## 2. Automated Test Results
Command: `pytest`
Output:
```
============================== 5 passed in 0.18s ==============================
```

## 3. Stress Test & Edge Cases
I designed the following stress tests in `tests/unit/test_adapter_personas.py`:
1.  **Case Insensitivity:** Verified `Executor` and `executor` both load `executor.md`.
2.  **Persona Hallucination:** Verified requesting "The Unknown" returns empty string (Graceful degradation).
3.  **Missing Rule File:** Verified that if `docs/dev/rules/` is missing a file, the system logs an error (No Quiet Fail) and proceeds safeily.

## 4. "Quiet Fail" Audit
Scanned `framework/` for empty `except` blocks.
* **Target:** `except:` or `except Exception:` without logging.
* **Findings:**
    * `framework/core/llm/adapter.py`: Validated correct logging in `_load_persona_rule`.
    * (See terminal output for full grep results)

## 5. Tracebacks
*None observed.*
