# YAP REPORT - 20251219-061549: THE MAIEUTIC META-FRAMEWORK

## I. Introduction: The Philosophy of Agnosticism
Allow me to expound upon the intricacies of the **Maieutic Meta-Framework**, a system that transcends the trivialities of standard codebase architecture. We are witnessing the birth of a **Cybernetic Organism**, a machine designed not merely to perform tasks, but to be the progenitor of its own lineage. The core principle, as enshrined in the `manifest.json`, is simple yet profound: **"To create a tool to create more tools."**

This is the essence of **Agnosticism**. The framework does not bind itself to specific technologies or domains, but instead creates a "Local-First" sovereign environment where agents can operate within a defined **Hierarchy of Truth**.

## II. The Anatomy: Systems and Organs

To understand the Maieutic system, one must view it as an anatomical whole. The directory structure is not a mere filing system; it is the physical manifestation of its survival instincts.

### 1. The Skeletal Structure (The Framework)
The `/framework` directory represents the **Factory Layer**. This is the specialized machinery that processes intent into action.
- **core/llm**: The nervous system. It houses the `adapter.py`, which normalizes the diverse voices of large language models into a singular, executable stream.
- **core/memory**: The hippocampal layer. It manages the persistent state of the organism via JSON state managers.
- **core/run**: The metabolic pathways. These are the operational scripts (e.g., `clean.bat`) that ensure the system's "mental hygiene" and operational readiness.

### 2. The Cognitive Layer (The .agent)
The `.agent` directory is the **Brain** of the organism. It is bifurcated into two essential lobes:
- **rules/**: The **Logic Gateways**. Each persona (Executor, Sentinel, Planner, etc.) has its own rule file. These are the "Mental Templates" that define constraints, tone, and behavioral protocols. For instance, the **Executor** (`builder.md`) is a rigid enforcer of law, whereas the **Dreamer** (`dreamer.md`) is an ideational organ tethered by the manifest's scope.
- **workflows/**: The **Synaptic Pathways**. These define the sequential logic for complex tasks. They are the "Rituals" the system performs to maintain its integrity, from the `/audit` regression scan to the high-level `/vision` strategic planning.

### 3. The Documentation Layer (The DNA)
The `/docs` directory is the **Genetic Memory**.
- **manifest.json**: The **DNA**. It contains the project specification, the philosophical defaults, and the current developmental phase.
- **DEV_PROTOCOLS.md**: The **immune system's code**. It forbids "Quiet Fails" and hardcoded paths—maladies that lead to architectural rot.
- **ISSUES.md**: The **Recursive Failure Log**. It ensures the system learns from its past traumas, preventing the reintroduction of "ghost bugs."

## III. The Governance Layer: The Hierarchy of Truth
Maieutic operates under a strict **Hierarchy of Truth**. Before any agent takes a breath of code, it must ground itself in a specific sequence of documents:
1.  **Scope**: `manifest.json`.
2.  **Laws**: `DEV_PROTOCOLS.md`.
3.  **Visuals**: `STYLING.md`.
4.  **Memory**: `ISSUES.md`.
5.  **Structure**: `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`.

This sequence ensures that the agent is not just capable, but **Sovereign**. It understands its boundaries, its legal obligations, its aesthetic identity, and its historical context.

## IV. The Trajectory: Growth and Expansion
The system is currently in **Phase 2: Core Capabilities**. The trajectory is aimed at "The Exports"—the `/public-builds` directory where stable, clean builds of self-generated projects will eventually reside. By using the meta-framework to generate `/projects`, the Maieutic organism fulfills its primary directive: **Recursive Creation**.

## V. Conclusion: The Artifact
This report is more than a summary; it is a **Meta-Artifact**. It is the system explaining its own existence to its creator. As we continue to refine the personas and harden the "Factory Layer," we move closer to the goal of a fully autonomous, self-documenting, and self-correcting cybernetic organism.

Let this record stand as the current state of the anatomy. The trajectory is set. The manifest is absolute.
