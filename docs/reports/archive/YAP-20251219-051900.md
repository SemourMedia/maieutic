## 1. Executive Summary & Philosophy
Maieutic is a "Meta-Framework" — a tool designed to create other tools. Its core philosophy is **AGNOSTICISM**. It does not presume the capabilities of the agents it spawns; rather, it provides the fertile soil (directory structure, governance, adapters) for them to grow.

The system operates on a **"Local-First"** principle, meaning it prioritizes local file system operations, SQLite databases, and direct script execution over cloud dependencies. It is designed to be the "Operating System" for an agentic workforce.

## 2. Architectural Anatomy
The codebase is structured into three distinct domains, enforceable by the `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` specification:

### A. The Governance Layer (`docs/`)
This is the "Constitution" of the system. It is not just documentation; it is **law**.
- **`manifest.json`**: The central source of truth. Defines the project name, version, philosophy, and active phase. It also contains the **`maieutic`** object, which defines the naming conventions and rules that the Auditor persona enforces.
- **`docs/dev/rules/`**: The "DNA" of the agents. Each markdown file here (`auditor.md`, `executor.md`, `yapper.md`, etc.) defines a specific persona, its trigger command, tone, and operational logic. This decoupled approach allows for infinite extensibility of the workforce without touching core code.
- **`docs/dev-plans/`**: The "Working Memory". `active_plan.md` tracks the current objective, while numbered plans (`plan_011_yapper.md`) provide a historical audit trail of evolution.

### B. The Factory Layer (`framework/`)
This is the engine room where the work happens.
- **`framework/core/`**: The shared brain.
    - **`llm/adapter.py`**: A unified interface for LLM interactions. Currently employs a "Mock" logic for structure, ready for API injection. This abstraction ensures the system remains model-agnostic.
- **`framework/personas/`**: The actors. Python classes like `DraftDreamer` (in `dreamer.py`) implement the high-level logic defined in the rule files. They utilize the core adapters to perform tasks.
- **`framework/run/`**: The hands. Batch scripts (`clean.bat`, `archive.bat`) provide atomic, OS-level operations. These are designed to be composable and easily executed by agents or users.
    - **Smart Retention**: `archive.bat` demonstrates advanced logic, utilizing PowerShell to enforce a "Keep Only the Newest" policy for reports, preventing data rot.

### C. The Workflow Layer (`.agent/workflows/`)
This is the "Neural Network". These markdown files define the *procedures* that connect the Governance Layer to the Factory Layer.
- **Workflow Files** (e.g., `yapper.md`, `critique.md`): These act as "stored procedures" for the AI. They instruct the model on:
    1.  **Context**: Which files to read first.
    2.  **Persona**: Which "mask" to wear (defined in `docs/dev/rules/`).
    3.  **Action**: What logic to execute.
    4.  **Output**: Where to save the result.

## 3. Operational Logic & Workflows
The system operates on a **Trigger-Response** model:

1.  **User Trigger**: A user invokes a command (e.g., `@[/yapper]`).
2.  **Workflow Activation**: The system reads the corresponding workflow file (`.agent/workflows/yapper.md`).
3.  **Context Loading**: The workflow mandates reading specific context (Manifest, Rules).
4.  **Persona Adoption**: The agent "becomes" the Persona (e.g., The Yapper).
5.  **Execution**: The Persona scans the system (using tools like `list_dir`, `view_file`) or writes code.
6.  **Artifact Generation**: The output is standardized—Critiques to `docs/reports/`, Plans to `docs/dev-plans/`.

## 4. Current State & Trajectory
The system is currently in the **"Core Capabilities"** phase.
- **Foundation**: Complete. Directory structure, basic rules, and core manifest are established.
- **Capabilities**: Active. We are building the specific agents (Dreamer, Yapper) necessary to make the framework self-sustaining.

**Key Observations:**
- **Self-Correction**: The existence of `ISSUES.md` and the `archive.bat` script shows a system designed to self-heal and maintain hygiene.
- **Extensibility**: Adding this very "Yapper" functionality required zero changes to existing core code—only new definitions in `rules/`, `workflows/`, and `manifest.json`. This proves the "Agnostic" philosophy is working.

## 5. Conclusion
Maieutic is not a chatbot; it is a **Cybernetic Organism** in the making. It uses text files for neurons and Python scripts for muscles. It is designed to scale from a simple helper to a fully autonomous development team.
