## AUDIT CHECKLIST

### 1. Quiet Fails (Empty Except Blocks)

| File | Line | Content | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `framework/core/llm/adapter.py` | 73 | `except FileNotFoundError:` | ✅ PASS |

**Analysis:** The exception block at line 73 is followed by proper logging at line 74: `self.logger.error(f"Rule file not found: ...")`. This is compliant with DEV_PROTOCOLS §3.

**Total Python Files Scanned:** 5  
**Quiet Fails Detected:** 0

---

### 2. Hardcoded Paths

| Pattern | Occurrences |
|---------|-------------|
| `C:\` or `D:\` | 0 |
| `/home/` | 0 |
| `/Users/` | 0 |

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No hardcoded absolute paths detected.

**Note:** Relative path `.agent/rules/{filename}` in `adapter.py` line 71 is acceptable per DEV_PROTOCOLS §4 (uses project-relative paths).

---

### 3. Historical Issue Regression Check

| Issue ID | Description | Regression Status |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| ISSUE_001 | Legacy `scripts/` and `web/` directories | ✅ No recurrence |
| ISSUE_002 | References to `start.bat`, `server.bat` | ✅ No recurrence |
| ISSUE_003 | Orphaned Plan 005 | ✅ No recurrence |

### 4. Governance Rule Compliance (Spot Check)

| Rule | Check | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| RUN_001 | Scripts documented in `help.bat` | ⚠️ NOT ENFORCED |
| RUN_002 | Archive script exists | ✅ `archive.bat` present |
| NAME_001 | Directories lowercase-hyphen | ✅ Compliant |
| NAME_002 | System files ALL_CAPS | ✅ Compliant |
| NAME_003 | Regular files lowercase_underscore | ✅ Compliant |

**Note:** ISSUE_006 documents that rules lack automated enforcement. This is a known liability, not a new finding.
