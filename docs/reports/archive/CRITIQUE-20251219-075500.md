# CRITIQUE - 20251219-075500
**Target:** `public-builds/template`
**Persona:** The Critic
**Status:** **FAIL** (Architectural Rot Detected)

## 1. Feature Bloat & Stale Logic
- **Stale Persona Orchestration:** The file `.agent/rules/rules.md` [L36-40] and `.agent/workflows/rules.md` [L5-9] still list 12+ personas as distinct entities. This is **stale logic** that ignores the recent consolidation to 8 personas. It will confuse any AI assistant using the template.
- **Redundant Governance:** Why are there `rules.md` files in both `.agent/rules/` and `.agent/workflows/`? This is "Dual-Source" dissonance. `manifest.json` is the only source of truth required for persona definitions.

## 2. Broken Hierarchy of Truth
- **Missing `STYLING.md`:** Both `rules.md` files refer to `docs/dev/STYLING.md` [L16 in rules.md]. This file does **not exist** in the template. Using the template immediately creates a broken link in the AI's core logic.
- **Empty Framework Modules:** `framework/core/llm`, `memory`, and `utils` are empty shells. If the framework isn't providing core logic yet, these should be removed until they serve a function. "Agnostic" doesn't mean "Empty."

## 3. Governance Violations
- **Manual Placeholders everywhere:** The `manifest.json.template` lacks the base governance rules (`NAME_001`, `RUN_001`, etc.) found in the parent project. Without these, child projects will immediately drift into naming chaos.
- **Hardcoded Placeholder Labels:** `[AGENT_IDENTITY]` and `[PROJECT_GOAL]` in `rules.md` are not properly handled by `maieutic-init.bat`. They will remain as strings in the initialized project.

## 🛑 REQUIRED AMPUTATIONS
1.  **DELETE:** `.agent/rules/rules.md` and `.agent/workflows/rules.md`. These are redundant and stale.
2.  **CONSOLIDATE:** Move the "Hierarchy of Truth" logic into the system-level rules or specific persona instructions.
3.  **SYNC:** Ensure `maieutic-init.bat` replaces **ALL** placeholders or removes the files containing them.
4.  **REINFORCE:** Inject the core governance rules (Naming, RUN_001) into `manifest.json.template`.

**Aesthetic Verdict:** This scaffold is a ghost ship. It has the rooms but no soul, and the navigation charts are from the wrong century.
