**Date:** 2025-12-19 06:41:38  
**Persona:** The Yap (Oral Historian / Chronicler)  
**Subject:** Comprehensive Architectural Exposition

## PREFACE: On the Nature of This Exposition

This document is not a summary. Summaries are for those who lack the patience to understand *why* a system exists. This is a **chronicle**—a complete anatomical dissection of the Maieutic meta-framework. Every organ, every sinew, every nerve-ending shall be illuminated.

The word *"Maieutic"* derives from the Greek *maieutikos* (μαιευτικός), meaning "of or pertaining to midwifery." In Socratic philosophy, it refers to the art of drawing forth knowledge that already exists within the student. This framework embodies that principle: it is a system designed to *birth other systems*. It does not create; it assists in creation.

---

## PART I: THE GOVERNANCE LAYER (The DNA)

The Governance Layer is the constitutional bedrock upon which all behavior is predicated. It is immutable in spirit, though mutable in implementation. Without governance, the framework is chaos—a collection of scripts with no guiding philosophy.

### 1.1 The Manifest (`manifest.json`)

The `manifest.json` is the **genome** of the project. It is a 160-line JSON document that encodes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `project` | The identity: name, version |
| `philosophy` | The soul: core principles, defaults |
| `phases` | The lifecycle: roadmap stages |
| `maieutic` | The meta-rules: naming conventions, personas, enforcement rules |

**Philosophical Encoding:**
```json
"philosophy": {
  "name": "Agnostic",
  "core_principle": "To create a tool to create more tools",
  "defaults": {
    "db": "sqlite",
    "network": "local-first"
  }
}
```

The philosophy section declares the framework's **agnosticism**—it is not bound to any specific project domain. It is a factory for factories. The `defaults` sub-object, however, reveals a preference: SQLite and local-first networking. This is the ghost of **Local Sovereignty**, the original philosophy from which Maieutic was derived.

**Persona Registry:**

The manifest contains a registry of 12 personas, each mapped to a rule file in `.agent/rules/`:

| Persona ID | Role | Rule File |
|------------|------|-----------|
| `builder` | The Executor | `.agent/rules/builder.md` |
| `planner` | The Planner | `.agent/rules/planner.md` |
| `visualizer` | The Visualizer | `.agent/rules/visualizer.md` |
| `tester` | The Tester | `.agent/rules/tester.md` |
| `protector` | The Sentinel | `.agent/rules/protector.md` |
| `visionary` | The Visionary | `.agent/rules/visionary.md` |
| `dreamer` | The Dreamer | `.agent/rules/dreamer.md` |
| `investor` | The Investor | `.agent/rules/investor.md` |
| `auditor` | The Auditor | `.agent/rules/auditor.md` |
| `critic` | The Critic | `.agent/rules/critic.md` |
| `updater` | The Updater | `.agent/rules/updater.md` |
| `yap` | The Yap | `.agent/rules/yapper.md` |

These personas are not mere labels—they are **behavioral contracts**. When a workflow invokes a persona, the AI agent must adopt that persona's worldview, constraints, and voice.

**Governance Rules:**

The `maieutic.rules` array contains 5 explicit rules:

1. **RUN_001:** Every `.bat` file in `framework/run/` MUST be documented in `help.bat`.
2. **RUN_002:** An archive script MUST exist to prevent report clutter.
3. **NAME_001:** Directories MUST be lowercase-hyphen-separated.
4. **NAME_002:** System files MUST be ALL_CAPS and listed in `MAIEUTIC-FILES.txt`.
5. **NAME_003:** Regular files MUST be lowercase-underscore-separated.

These rules are enforced by the **Auditor** persona during `/audit` invocations.

---

### 1.2 The System Files (`MAIEUTIC-FILES.txt`)

The `MAIEUTIC-FILES.txt` file is a manifest of all system-level files that belong to the Maieutic framework itself (as opposed to user-generated content). These files are subject to stricter naming conventions and governance.

---

### 1.3 The README (`README.md`)

The README is a **template**. It contains placeholders (`[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[SHORT_DESCRIPTION]`, `[LANGUAGE]`) that are intended to be populated when Maieutic is used to scaffold a new project. This is evidence of the framework's **agnostic design**—it does not presume to know what project it will birth.

Key excerpts:

```markdown
**Philosophy: Local Sovereignty**
This project conforms to the "Local Asset OS" standard.
*   Database: SQLite (Default)
*   Network: Local-First
*   Data Owner: You (Sole Owner)
```

Despite the manifest's "Agnostic" philosophy, the README still references "Local Sovereignty." This is a vestige of the framework's origin—it was extracted from a project called "Local Asset OS," which was a local-first email and asset management system.

---

## PART II: THE FACTORY LAYER (The Muscles)

The Factory Layer is where code lives. It is the **productive engine** of the framework—the muscles that execute the will of governance.

### 2.1 Directory Anatomy

```
/framework
├── __init__.py           # Python package marker
├── /core                 # Core Logic (The Brain)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── /llm              # LLM Adapter Layer
│   ├── /memory           # JSON State Managers
│   └── /utils            # Shared Utilities
├── /personas             # Agent Logic (The Personalities)

│   └── test.bat          # Test runner
└── /templates            # Jinja2 Templates (The Blueprints)
```

### 2.2 The Core (`/framework/core`)

The core is subdivided into three domains:

**2.2.1 LLM Adapter (`/core/llm`)**

This directory contains the **adapter pattern** for Large Language Model integration. The framework is designed to be LLM-agnostic—it should work with any provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) through a common interface.

**2.2.2 Memory (`/core/memory`)**

The memory subsystem handles **stateful JSON persistence**. In a Maieutic project, state is often stored in JSON files rather than databases, adhering to the "Local Sovereignty" principle of human-readable, portable data.

**2.2.3 Utils (`/core/utils`)**

Shared utilities: logging, config loading, path resolution. These are the **housekeeping functions** that prevent code duplication.

### 2.3 The Personas (`/framework/personas`)

This directory is intended to contain Python implementations of persona behavior. Currently, it appears to be sparsely populated (2 items), suggesting the framework relies primarily on the rule files in `.agent/rules/` for persona definitions, with Python code providing supporting logic.

### 2.4 The Run Scripts (`/framework/run`)

Four batch files constitute the operational interface:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `help.bat` | Lists all available scripts and their functions |
| `archive.bat` | Moves old reports to `docs/archive/reports/`, implementing smart retention |
| `clean.bat` | Removes `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files |
| `test.bat` | Runs the test suite via pytest |

These scripts are the **command-line interface** for developers working within the framework.

---

## PART III: THE WORKFLOW LAYER (The Nervous System)

The Workflow Layer is the **reactive nervous system** of Maieutic. It consists of 15 workflow files in `.agent/workflows/` that define how the AI agent responds to slash commands.

### 3.1 Workflow Manifest

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `audit.md` | `/audit` | Cold regression scan for quiet fails and hardcoded paths |
| `build.md` | `/build` | Execute implementation plans with strict protocol adherence |
| `compete.md` | `/compete` | Benchmark against market leaders |
| `critique.md` | `/critique` | Identify feature bloat and over-engineering |
| `dream.md` | `/dream` | Brainstorm and validate ideas against scope |
| `invest.md` | `/invest` | Evaluate ROI and prioritize technical debt |
| `plan.md` | `/plan` | Create step-by-step implementation plans |
| `rules.md` | `/rules` | View conditional rules |
| `secure.md` | `/secure` | Security audit using Zero Trust principles |
| `starter.md` | `/starter` | Interactive manifest population wizard |
| `test.md` | `/test` | Design stress tests and edge cases |
| `update.md` | `/update` | Archive plans and sync documentation |
| `vibe.md` | `/vibe` | Audit UI for design system compliance |
| `vision.md` | `/vision` | Align tasks with long-term strategic goals |
| `yap.md` | `/yap` | Generate comprehensive codebase explanations |

### 3.2 Workflow Anatomy

Each workflow file follows a standard format:

```yaml
---
description: [Short description of the workflow]
---

1. Read the following context files:
   - [file1]
   - [file2]

2. Adopt the persona of "[PERSONA]" and execute the following logic:
   - **Prompt**: "[Instructions]"
   - **Output**: [Expected output format and location]
```

This structure ensures **deterministic behavior**—the AI agent knows exactly which files to read, which persona to adopt, and where to save its output.

---

## PART IV: THE PERSONA LAYER (The Personalities)

The Persona Layer is the **psychological substrate** of the framework. Each persona is a distinct behavioral contract defined in `.agent/rules/`.

### 4.1 The 14 Personas

| Persona | Archetype | Core Directive |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Auditor** | The Inspector | Hunt for regressions, quiet fails, and pattern violations |
| **Builder** | The Executor | Implement plans with rigid protocol adherence |
| **Critic** | The Radical Essentialist | Demand code deletion, enforce YAGNI |
| **Dreamer** | The Idealist | Brainstorm features, check against scope |
| **Investor** | The Capitalist | Evaluate ROI, manage technical debt |
| **Planner** | The Architect | Create safe, reversible implementation plans |
| **Protector** | The Sentinel | Audit for security vulnerabilities |
| **Starter** | The Midwife | Guide manifest population |
| **Tester** | The Breaker | Design stress tests to break code |
| **Updater** | The Janitor | Archive completed work, sync documentation |
| **Visionary** | The Prophet | Align with long-term strategic goals |
| **Visualizer** | The Aesthete | Enforce design system compliance |
| **Yapper** | The Chronicler | Generate expansive documentation |
| **Rules** | Meta-persona | Explain conditional rules |

### 4.2 Persona Structure

Each persona rule file contains:

1. **Trigger:** The slash command that activates the persona
2. **Archetype:** A metaphorical identity (e.g., "The Radical Essentialist")
3. **Core Directive:** The primary mission
4. **Worldview:** A hierarchy of truth that guides decision-making
5. **Behavioral Protocols:** Specific actions and constraints
6. **Voice:** Stylistic guidelines (tone, keywords, example phrases)

This structure ensures that personas are not merely functional—they are **characterful**. The Critic speaks with sarcasm; the Yapper speaks with verbosity; the Protector speaks with paranoia.

---

## PART V: THE DOCUMENTATION LAYER (The Memory)

The Documentation Layer is the **long-term memory** of the framework. It resides in `/docs/` and contains:

### 5.1 System Documents (`/docs/dev/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENT_LOGIC.md` | Explains how AI agents interact with the framework |
| `DEV_PROTOCOLS.md` | Coding standards and conventions |
| `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` | Canonical file/folder map |
| `FEATURES_ENHANCEMENTS.md` | Roadmap for future development |
| `ISSUES.md` | Known bugs and technical debt |
| `STYLING.md` | Visual design specifications |

### 5.2 Development Plans (`/docs/dev-plans/`)

This directory contains:
- `active_plan.md` — The currently active implementation plan
- `plan_XXX_*.md` — Individual plan files (e.g., `plan_013_auto_increment_plans.md`)

Plans follow a strict template with sections for Goal Description, User Review Required, Proposed Changes, and Verification Plan.

### 5.3 Archives (`/docs/archive/`)

The archive contains two subdirectories:
- `/plans/` — 13 archived implementation plans
- `/reports/` — 5 archived reports (audits, critiques, etc.)

This structure implements **smart retention**: active reports live in `/docs/reports/`, and when new reports are generated, old ones are moved to the archive.

### 5.4 Reports (`/docs/reports/`)

Active reports are stored here with timestamped filenames following the pattern `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`:
- `AUDIT-*.md`
- `CRITIQUE-*.md`
- `YAP-*.md`
- etc.

---

## PART VI: THE PRODUCT LAYER (The Offspring)

Maieutic is a meta-framework—it exists to create other projects. The product layer consists of:

### 6.1 Projects (`/projects/`)

This directory contains 2 items (presumably project scaffolds or active projects being developed using Maieutic).

### 6.2 Public Builds (`/public-builds/`)

This directory is intended for clean, distributable builds that can be shared or deployed.

---

## PART VII: THE DATA LAYER (The Bloodstream)

### 7.1 Configuration (`/config/`)

Contains:
- `settings.yaml` — Global settings
- `secrets.yaml` — Local secrets (gitignored)

The use of YAML files over environment variables reflects the "Local Sovereignty" philosophy—configuration should be visible, portable, and human-editable.

### 7.2 Data (`/data/`)

Contains:
- Primary database file (SQLite by default)
- `workflow_scratchpad.md` — Current roadmap/notes
- `/logs/` — Operation logs

---

## PART VIII: THE TESTING LAYER (The Immune System)

### 8.1 Test Structure (`/tests/`)

The tests directory contains 7 items, organized into:
- `/unit/` — Unit tests
- `/integration/` — Integration tests

Tests are run via `framework/run/test.bat`, which invokes pytest.

---

## CONCLUSION: The Trajectory of Maieutic

Maieutic is not a product; it is a **production system**. It is a meta-framework designed to scaffold, govern, and guide the development of future projects. Its architecture reflects a philosophy of:

1. **Governance First:** Rules are explicit, enforceable, and centralized.
2. **Persona-Driven Development:** AI agents adopt behavioral contracts to ensure consistent, predictable outputs.
3. **Local Sovereignty:** Data stays local, readable, and owned by the user.
4. **Structured Chaos:** Creativity (via Dreamer, Visionary) is balanced by constraint (via Critic, Auditor).

The framework is currently in **Phase 2: Core Capabilities**, with 13 archived plans and an active plan for auto-incrementing plan counters. The governance is robust but heavy; the persona system is expressive but bloated.

The path forward requires **disciplined pruning**—cutting personas that overlap, enforcing rules that currently exist only on paper, and maintaining fidelity to the Local Sovereignty philosophy that gave this project its soul.
