# CRITIQUE - 20251219-080500
**Target:** `public-builds/template/manifest.json.template`
**Persona:** The Critic
**Status:** **WARNING** (Structural Dissonance)

## 1. Placeholder Dissonance
- **Orphaned Prompts:** The `maieutic-init.bat` script prompts for `AGENT_IDENTITY` and `PROJECT_GOAL`, but `manifest.json.template` contains no corresponding placeholders. These values are collected but never stored in the system's "Master Spec." This is **leakage**.
- **Recommendation:** Add `"identity": "[AGENT_IDENTITY]"` and `"description": "[PROJECT_GOAL]"` (or similar) to the manifest root or philosophy block.

## 2. Naming Convention Bloat
- **Architecture Theater:** The `naming_conventions` block includes complex regex strings (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`). While theoretically useful for automation, carrying these in a clean template without an enforcement tool (like a linter) is **feature bloat**. It adds 20 lines of JSON that are essentially dead air.

## 3. Rationale Decay
- **Dogmatic Drift:** The rationale for `PERSONA_001` in the template is a truncated version of the parent project. In the parent, it justifies personas as "essential to multi-perspective analysis." In the template, it ends abruptly.
- **Verdict:** If the governance is to be propagating, it must be identical. A copy of the law with missing pages is a weak foundation.

## 4. Redundant Structure
- **Duplicated Personas:** Every project initialized gets a 50-line list of personas that the user likely won't change (and isn't allowed to per `PERSONA_001`). This is the cost of "Local Sovereignty," but it makes the manifest feel cluttered for a "Quick Start."

---

## 🛑 REQUIRED AMPUTATIONS / SYNC
1.  **REINFORCE:** Add placeholders to `manifest.json.template` to catch the data from `maieutic-init.bat`.
2.  **AUDIT:** Decide if `naming_conventions` regex belongs in a clean scaffold or should be injected only when the `auditor` persona is first triggered.
3.  **STABILIZE:** Sync the `PERSONA_001` rationale to match the parent project word-for-word.

**Aesthetic Verdict:** The manifest is functional but carries "Ghost Parameters." It's like having a dashboard with knobs that aren't connected to the engine.
