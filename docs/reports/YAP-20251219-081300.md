# YAP REPORT - 20251219-081300
## Comprehensive Deployment & Startup Guide for Maieutic

**Prepared by:** The Yapper (System Exposition Persona)
**Target Audience:** New Users, Developers, AI Assistants
**Scope:** Complete deployment lifecycle from acquisition to first workflow execution.

---

## Part I: Understanding Maieutic

### 1.1 What is Maieutic?

Maieutic is a **meta-framework** — a tool designed to create other tools. Named after the Socratic method of "midwifery" (drawing forth knowledge through dialogue), it provides:

- **Governance:** Strict rules for naming, documentation, and coding.
- **Workflows:** 15 slash-command triggers for AI-assisted development.
- **Personas:** 8 distinct AI personality modes for different cognitive tasks.
- **Self-Propagation:** The ability to initialize itself into new projects.

### 1.2 Core Philosophy: Local Sovereignty

Maieutic enforces a **Local-First** philosophy:
- **Database:** SQLite (no external dependencies)
- **Network:** Offline-capable, no cloud requirements
- **Data Owner:** You are the sole owner of all data

---

## Part II: Deployment Methods

There are **two deployment scenarios** for Maieutic:

### 2.1 Method A: Cloning the Parent Repository (For Development)

Use this method if you intend to contribute to or extend the Maieutic framework itself.

```powershell
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_ORG]/maieutic.git
cd maieutic

# Step 2: Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Step 3: Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 4: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Verify installation
framework\run\help.bat
```

**Expected Output from `help.bat`:**
```
maieutic run commands:
----------------------------------------------------------------
run\help.bat          - Display this help menu
run\clean.bat         - Remove __pycache__ and .pyc files
run\test.bat          - Run automated tests
run\archive.bat       - Archive old reports (audits/critiques)

Maintenance:
----------------------------------------------------------------
(No scripts yet - see ISSUE_002)

Development:
----------------------------------------------------------------
public-builds\maieutic-init.bat - Initialize Maieutic in a new project
----------------------------------------------------------------
```

---

### 2.2 Method B: Initializing Maieutic into a New Project (For Production)

Use this method to scaffold Maieutic into an **external, standalone project**.

#### Step 1: Acquire the Initialization Package

Copy the following files/folders to your new project's root directory:

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| `public-builds/maieutic-init.bat` | `[NEW_PROJECT]/maieutic-init.bat` |
| `public-builds/template/` | `[NEW_PROJECT]/template/` |

Your new project root should look like:
```
[NEW_PROJECT]/
├── maieutic-init.bat
└── template/
    ├── .agent/
    ├── config/
    ├── data/
    ├── docs/
    ├── framework/
    ├── manifest.json.template
    ├── projects/
    └── tests/
```

#### Step 2: Run the Initialization Script

```powershell
cd [NEW_PROJECT]
.\maieutic-init.bat
```

**Interactive Prompts:**

The script will ask for 4 values:

| Prompt | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Enter project name:` | The human-readable name of your project | *(Required)* |
| `Enter version:` | Semantic version (e.g., 0.1.0) | `0.1.0` |
| `Enter agent identity:` | How the AI should identify itself | `Lead Developer` |
| `Enter project goal:` | The mission statement for your project | `To build a great tool.` |

**Example Session:**
```
================================================================
  MAIEUTIC FRAMEWORK INITIALIZER
  "A tool to create more tools"
================================================================

Enter project name: MyAwesomeApp
Enter version (default: 0.1.0): 1.0.0
Enter agent identity (e.g. Lead Developer): Chief Architect
Enter project goal: To revolutionize local-first data management.

[INFO] Initializing Maieutic for: MyAwesomeApp v1.0.0

[1/4] Copying framework structure...
[2/4] Creating manifest.json...
[3/4] Creating .gitignore...
[4/4] Creating requirements.txt...

================================================================
  SUCCESS! Maieutic initialized for: MyAwesomeApp
================================================================

Next steps:
  1. Run: python -m venv venv
  2. Run: venv\Scripts\activate
  3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. Use /plan, /build, /audit workflows with your AI assistant

Happy building!
```

#### Step 3: Post-Initialization Setup

After initialization, you may safely delete the `template/` folder and `maieutic-init.bat` as they are no longer needed.

```powershell
# Optional cleanup
Remove-Item -Path "template" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "maieutic-init.bat" -Force
```

## Part III: Directory Anatomy

After initialization, your project will have the following structure:

```
[PROJECT_ROOT]/
│
├── manifest.json           # 🧬 THE DNA — Project spec, philosophy, personas, rules
├── .agent/                 # 🧠 THE BRAIN — AI configuration

```

## Part IV: First Workflow Execution

Once Maieutic is initialized, you interact with it through **slash commands** given to your AI assistant.

### 4.1 The Workflow Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[/plan] --> B[Active Plan Created]
    B --> C[/build]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[/audit]
    E --> F{Pass?}
    F -->|Yes| G[/update]
    F -->|No| C
    G --> H[Plan Archived]
```

### 4.2 Essential Commands

| Command | When to Use | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `/plan [TASK]` | Starting new work | Creates a numbered plan in `docs/dev-plans/` |
| `/build` | After plan is approved | Implements the `active_plan.md` |
| `/audit` | After implementation | Scans for regressions and governance violations |
| `/critique [TARGET]` | To identify bloat | Harsh review of code/architecture |
| `/update` | After plan completion | Archives plan, resets workspace |

### 4.3 Example: Creating Your First Plan

```
User: /plan Create a user authentication module

AI (The Planner): I have analyzed the trajectory...

*Creates:* docs/dev-plans/plan_001_user_authentication.md
*Updates:* manifest.json (latest_plan_number: 1)
```

---

## Part V: Governance Rules

Maieutic enforces strict governance through the `manifest.json` file. Violations are flagged by The Auditor persona.

### 5.1 Naming Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Directories | `lowercase-hyphen-separated` | `my-feature/` |
| System Files | `ALL_CAPS` | `ISSUES.md` |
| Regular Files | `lowercase_underscore_separated` | `my_module.py` |
| Reports | `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` | `AUDIT-20251219-143000.md` |

### 5.2 Operational Rules

| Rule ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `RUN_001` | Every `.bat` file in `framework/run/` MUST be documented in `help.bat`. |
| `RUN_002` | An archive script MUST exist to keep only the latest report in `docs/reports/`. |
| `PERSONA_001` | Personas are IMMUTABLE. They cannot be removed or consolidated. |

---

## Part VI: Troubleshooting

### 6.1 "manifest.json already exists"

**Cause:** You are trying to run `maieutic-init.bat` in a directory that already has Maieutic initialized.

**Solution:** Initialize in a fresh, empty directory.

---

### 6.2 "Template directory not found"

**Cause:** The `template/` folder is not alongside `maieutic-init.bat`.

**Solution:** Ensure both the script and the template folder are in the same directory.

---

### 6.3 Placeholders remain in `manifest.json`

**Cause:** PowerShell string replacement failed (special characters in input).

**Solution:** Manually edit `manifest.json` to replace `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[VERSION]`, `[AGENT_IDENTITY]`, and `[PROJECT_GOAL]`.

---

## Part VII: Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Meta-Framework** | A framework that generates or manages other frameworks/projects. |
| **Persona** | A distinct AI personality mode with specific capabilities and voice. |
| **Workflow** | A predefined sequence of actions triggered by a slash command. |
| **Local Sovereignty** | The principle that all data is owned and stored locally by the user. |
| **Manifest** | The `manifest.json` file — the single source of truth for the project. |
| **The Hierarchy of Truth** | The ordered priority of configuration files (manifest > protocols > styles > issues). |
